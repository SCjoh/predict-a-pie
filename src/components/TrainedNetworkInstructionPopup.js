          The Neural Network in this activity has been trained on thousands of
          recipes to be able to classify any recipe as "Sweet Pie", "Quiche",
          "Savoury Pie" and "Other" from a combination of the input ingredients.
          Now it can generalize and classify any of the millions of combinations
          of recipes.

          to the URL that it generates.

          Try different combinations of ingredients and see what the Neural
          Network thinks of them! You can also click on the "
